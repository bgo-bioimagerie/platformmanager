### HTML - PDF Template

By default, pdf invoices are generated using an integrated template. You can also upload a template of yours if needed. Templating langage used is Twig.

## Generating invoices

General informations:

- when used, the period concerns reservations start dates: only reservations *started* between begin period (included) and perdiod end (excluded) will be considered.

- after having requested invoice generation by clicking *save*, you will be redirected to the *To send invoices* page where your invoice should be listed.
- In some cases (especially if you requested invoice for all clients for an entire year), the invoice generation can take time.
In this case, the list of invoices in generation process is displayed at the top of the page. You can click *refresh* button to refresh theirs generation state information.

- You can then check if an invoice informations are correct by clicking on its *Edit* button.

- For more information on invoices edition, see [Editing invoices](./#editing-invoices).
