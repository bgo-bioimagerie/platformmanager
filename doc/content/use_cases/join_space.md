Since Platform-Manager V2 (2021-08-10 release), users with an existing account can request to join a space. 

## Request join

First, click on *Menus* in top navbar and choose the structure on which the space you want to join depends.
Then you should see, amongst one or several tiles, the one you are looking for.

Click on *Join* button contained in this tile.

Until your join request is accepted or rejected by a space admin, the join button now is inactive and displays *Join requested*.

## Join request management

As a space admin, you are notified by mail when a user requests to join your space.

You can accept or reject this request by going into user Menu from your space home page.

Then go into *Pending accounts* (left sidebar menu).

If you want to accept the request, click *Activate* button, then affect a role to the user.

If you want to reject the request, click *Delete* button.

In both cases, user is notified by email.
