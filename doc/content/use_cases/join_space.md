Since Platform-Manager V2 (2021-08-10 release), users with an existing account can request to join a space. 

## Join a space as a user

- [you already have an account](#request-access)

- [you don't have an account yet](#create-a-user-account)

### Request access

First, find the space you want to request access to. From Platform-Manager main page, you can select its parent structure if or search for the space name.
Then you should see, amongst one or several tiles, the one you are looking for.

If the space is public, a "Request access" button will appear on its tile. Click it. If private, contact the support at the email address specified on the tile.

Once you clicked "Request access", until your join request is accepted or rejected by a space admin, the join button now is inactive and displays *Join requested*.

### Create a user account

You can Create an account by clicking *Create an account* in the top right corner of the interface.

Then enter your informations.

In the *Access to* input, you can choose to which space you want to request access.

You will receive an email with a confirmation link. Once used, your account will be active.

When the admin of the space you requested to join will accept or reject your request, you will be notified by email.

If your request is accepted, you'll then have access to the requested space with the [role](../../modules/module/users/#user-space-role) you were granted.

## Join request management

### Your space is public

As a space admin, you are notified by mail when a user requests to join your space.

![join space](../../join_space_3.png)

You can accept or reject this request by going into user Menu from your space home page.

![join space](../../join_space_4.png)

Then go into *Pending accounts* (left sidebar menu).

![join space](../../join_space_5.png)

If you want to accept the request, click *Activate* button, then affect a role to the user.

![join space](../../join_space_6.png)

If you want to reject the request, click *Delete* button.

In both cases, user is notified by email.

### Your space is private

Since Platform-Manager V2.3 (2022-01-31 release), users with an existing account cannot request to join private spaces.

It's the space amdin's role to *add users* in module Users > Add User.

![join space](../../join_space_8.png)

#### Users already have an account

You can add them by entering their login and setting their role.

#### Users don't have an account yet

You can then directly create accounts (or ask users to do so). Accounts credentials will be sent to users by email.

You will then have to give them a role in pending accounts > Activate
