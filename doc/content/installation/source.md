## Install from source code

Clone git repository from [https://github.com/bgo-bioimagerie/platformmanager](https://github.com/bgo-bioimagerie/platformmanager).

Stable code is in *master* branch.

Releases can also be download from [https://github.com/bgo-bioimagerie/platformmanager/releases](https://github.com/bgo-bioimagerie/platformmanager/releases).

Code contains some .htaccess to limit access to specific directories. If not using
Apache as frontend, you need to restrict access yourself based on .htaccess files
definition.

In Config, define a *conf.ini* (see [Configuration](./configuration/)) with 
appropriate setup.
