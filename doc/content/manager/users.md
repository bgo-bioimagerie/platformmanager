## Users creation

Users cannot register for an account, space managers must create the user for
their space if user does not already have an account
(they will receive a temporary password by email).
If user already have an account, he can request to join the space via the web
interface (Join button).

## Create a user as a space admin

If you want to directly link a user to a specific space or if you are *space admin*, not superadmin, you can create user from within a space by going into *Users module* in your space homepage.

The *Create an account* screen displays.

When validated, an email is send to the new user with their credentials. User have now access to Platform-Manager.
To allow them access to this space, you still need to affect them a role.

Still in *Users module*, go into *Pending accounts*, at the top of the left side menu.

The user you just created is listed amongst the other pending users accounts.

You can choose to *Activate* or *Delete* them:

* *Delete* will detach users from this space. They will no longer appear in Pending accounts but they will still be able to connect to Platform-Manager since their account will not be deleted
* By clicking *Activate*, you will navigate to the activation screen where you can affect a role to the user.

When activated, users are notified by email that they have now access to your space.

If you go back to Active Users screen (and set the filter by letter to *All*), you can now see the user you just activated.
