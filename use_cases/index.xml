      <description>Since Platform-Manager V2 (2021-08-10 release), users with an existing account can request to join a space.
Join a space as a user you already have an account
you don&amp;rsquo;t have an account yet
Request access First, find the space you want to request access to. From Platform-Manager main page, you can select its parent structure if or search for the space name. Then you should see, amongst one or several tiles, the one you are looking for.</description>
